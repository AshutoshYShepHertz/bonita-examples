This project illustrates how to use Bonita BPM REST APIs.

Please download a Bonita Tomcat bundle from website http://www.bonitasoft.com/how-we-do-it/downloads
Unzip it on any location on your computer (please avoid spaces or special characters in path)
Start it using <tomcat home>/bin/startup(.sh | .bat)

To run the application, complete these steps:

1 Download the source of the example from GitHub.
2 Compile it with Maven: mvn clean install. This creates a jar file called rest-api-example-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar and a zip file called rest-api-example-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.zip where x.y.z is the version number of the application.
3 Start Tomcat.
4 Unzip rest-api-example-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.zip.
5 Move inside the unzipped folder.
6 Start the application: java -jar rest-api-example-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.
